# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#
# This convention just makes grammars more readable to humans.  Thus:
#
#    - You should follow this convention unless you have a good reason
#      not to.
#
#    - But your *program* should still work with grammars that don't
#      follow this convention.  It should not pay any attention to
#      upper/lower case.  From your program's point of view,
#      if there is at least one rule for rewriting a symbol, then
#      that symbol is a nonterminal and should be rewritten.

#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective
